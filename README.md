# Objective
The aim is to forecast future sales, expenditure, or revenue by using the historical Time Series data generated by Adidas quarterly revenue from 2000 to 2021

# Why we use it
Every business is looking for strategies to improve its profits. Data science professionals play a major role in providing the most accurate predictions for any given time. The data generated by a company is always handy for analyzing the future behaviour of target customers. By predicting future business trends, a business can make better decisions to improve its future performance.

## Step-by-step approach
- Imported necessary Python libraries and Dataset
- Visualized Revenue against quarterly time period
- Checked the seasonality as the quarterly revenue increases and decreases every quarter.
- We will use the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average(SARIMA) model to forecast the quarterly sales revenue of Adidas. Before using the SARIMA model, it is necessary to find the p, d, and q values.
- As the data is not stationary, the value of d is 1. To find the values of p and q, we can use the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots
- Now we train a SARIMA model to predict the quarterly revenue of Adidas using SARIMAX
- Finally we forecast the quarterly revenue of Adidas for the next eight quarters
