# Objective
The aim is to forecast future sales, expenditure, or revenue by using the historical Time Series data generated by Adidas revenue data from 2000 to 2021

# Why we use it
Every business is looking for strategies to improve its profits. Data science professionals play a major role in providing the most accurate predictions for any given time. The data generated by a company is always handy for analyzing the future behaviour of target customers. By predicting future business trends, a business can make better decisions to improve its future performance.

## Step-by-step approach
- Imported necessary Python libraries and Dataset
- Performed data modification and data transformation to prepare the data for a neural network
- Divided the data for training and testing
- Created a function to split the data as LSTM layers only accept sequences of the same length. Thus, each sentence that appears as an integer in the data must be completed with the same length
- Now we import packages like Tensorflow and Keras to train our neural network
- Built layers that will take the dimensions of the LSTM layer and give the maximum length and maximum tags as output
- Create a helper function that will help us to give the summary of each layer of the neural network model for the task of recognizing named entities with Python
- Finally I will use the spacy library in Python to test our NER model. I will add input of some lines about my self and letâ€™s see what we will get after running the code
